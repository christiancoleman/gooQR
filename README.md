# gooQR
A python *3* program that creates QR codes based on your secret keys from Google Authenticator. I made this because one of my Google Authenticator codes was around 65 characters long and thumb-typing that in sounded just awful.

One benefit to this solution is that it runs client side and there is no worry that I'm stealing your data. The program is really, really small too so it's easy to double check. The solutions I saw on Google were all hosted on web sites and that just didn't seem safe.
